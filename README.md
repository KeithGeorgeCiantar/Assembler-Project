# Nand to Tetris Assembler Project

This is the work for project 6 of the [Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course. It formed part of the labs for the study-unit CCE2017 (Computer Systems and Organization).

## Objective

Following the specifications listed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CITliwTJzq19ibBF5EeuNBZ3MJ01dKoI/view), the main objective is to "Develop an assembler that translates programs written in the Hack assembly language into Hack binary code." For this work, the assembler does not perform error checking, as it assumes the code is valid.

## Overview

The program takes the `.asm` file as a command-line argument and converts into a `.hack` file. Using the CPU emulator from the course, one can run the assembled .hack to check that the output is correct.
